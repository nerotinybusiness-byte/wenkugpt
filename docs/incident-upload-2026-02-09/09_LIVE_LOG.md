# Live Log

Use this file as append-only progress log.

## 2026-02-09
- Created incident documentation bundle for cross-window continuity.
- Confirmed root cause path: missing `x-user-email` in client fetch calls.
- Confirmed production ingest works when header is provided manually.
- Confirmed parser file has local modifications under active validation.
- User requested explicit implementation plan before code fix execution.
- User requested continuous markdown evidence across chat windows.
- Added implementation tracker and conversation context docs to support that process.
- Locked next action: implement shared client API helper and migrate target fetch call sites.
- Implemented shared helper `src/lib/api/client-request.ts` with identity resolution and `apiFetch`.
- Migrated API calls in `src/components/ingest/FileUploader.tsx`.
- Migrated API calls in `src/components/ingest/FileList.tsx`.
- Migrated API calls in `src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`.
- Ran verification gates:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (27 tests).
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Current status: ready for runtime validation (local browser + production browser).
- Deployed production build:
  - `https://wenkugpt-copy-96rf8aw2g-nerotinys-projects.vercel.app`
  - Alias `https://wenkugpt-copy.vercel.app` points to this deployment.
- Production ingest API smoke check with header passed:
  - `POST /api/ingest` returned `success: true`.
- Production history API smoke checks:
  - With header: `GET /api/history?limit=1` returned `success: true`.
  - Without header: `GET /api/history?limit=1` returned `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED`.
- Remaining validation: browser-based upload/chat flow confirmation with new frontend header injection.
- Added temporary compatibility fallback in client helper when env/storage identity is missing:
  - fallback email: `admin@example.com`.
- Re-ran verification gates after fallback change:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (27 tests).
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Deployed updated build:
  - `https://wenkugpt-copy-jh17adf7h-nerotinys-projects.vercel.app`
  - Alias `https://wenkugpt-copy.vercel.app` now points to this deployment.
- Re-ran production API smoke checks:
  - `POST /api/ingest` with header returned `success: true`.
  - `GET /api/history?limit=1` with header returned `success: true`.
  - `GET /api/history?limit=1` without header returned `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED`.
- Remaining validation: explicit browser UX check (upload/chat/list/delete/preview) on the deployed frontend.
- User reported confusing file names in library (storage key visible in UI).
- Root cause confirmed: ingest stores `filename` as internal storage key format `userId_uuid_safeFilename`.
- UI refinement implemented in `src/components/ingest/FileList.tsx`:
  - display now strips technical prefix when pattern matches UUID_UUID_name.
  - filtering now works with both display filename and raw stored filename.
  - preview modal title uses cleaned display filename.
- Re-ran local gates after UI refinement:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (27 tests).
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Deployed UI filename refinement:
  - `https://wenkugpt-copy-22h90gzbc-nerotinys-projects.vercel.app`
  - alias `https://wenkugpt-copy.vercel.app` updated.

- Closed UI/docs follow-up:
  - fixed chat history class typo `truncat` -> `truncate` in `src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`.
  - removed obsolete `ALLOW_HEADERLESS_AUTH` from `.env.example`.
  - documented unsupported status of `ALLOW_HEADERLESS_AUTH` in `README.md` and `docs/api.md`.
  - updated risk register entry for env/docs drift as resolved.
- EOD handoff prepared for 2026-02-10: `17_EOD_HANDOFF_2026-02-09.md` with summary, open items, and restart checklist.

## 2026-02-10
- Started RAG v2 implementation track (`Slang-aware Context Graph Memory`) on branch `feat/rag-engine-switch`.
- Added dedicated v2 documentation and append-only live log under `docs/rag-v2/`.
- Implemented v2 graph-memory schema + migration, query flow scaffolding, feature flags, and API wiring.
- Extended Settings payload for scoped/temporal/ambiguity controls.
- Validation after v2 implementation:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (32 tests).
- Started end-to-end PDF highlight precision remediation after user approval:
  - decision confirmed: full code fix + full document reupload/reingest.
  - implemented ingest matching hardening in `src/lib/ingest/chunker.ts` (page-local block matching).
  - implemented highlight metadata hardening in `src/lib/ingest/pipeline.ts` (sanitize/dedupe/merge/cap).
  - implemented viewer hardening in `src/components/chat/PDFViewer.tsx`:
    - coarse detection for multi-box highlight sets
    - tighter context-text fallback thresholding
    - visible highlight mode label (`bbox` vs `context-text`)
  - improved citation context composition in `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`.
  - expanded diagnostics in `scripts/check_bboxes.ts` to include highlight box density/coarse indicators.
  - added regression tests:
    - `src/lib/ingest/__tests__/chunker.test.ts` (page-local sourceBlocks)
    - `src/components/chat/__tests__/pdfHighlightUtils.test.ts`
- Current status: implementation in progress; static/test gate run pending; runtime validation pending reupload.
- Ran static/test gates for remediation branch:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (38 tests).
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Current status: code changes and automated gates are green; pending runtime validation after document reupload/reingest.
- Executed data reset and reingest workflow:
  - `node scripts/clear_docs.js` completed.
  - `node scripts/check_files.js` confirmed `Total documents in DB: 0`.
  - Supabase bucket `documents` list confirmed `74` objects, `72` supported (`.pdf/.txt`).
  - Bulk reingest via `processPipeline` from storage completed `72/72` success, `0` failures.
  - DB post-check after dedupe: `22` unique documents.
- Smoke retrieval check run for query `kde je sklad wenku?`:
  - retrieval returned relevant Wenku sources and address snippets (`Na Hanspaulce ...`).
  - source highlight metadata still classified as coarse on several top hits, but no ingest/runtime failures.
- Root cause refinement found in viewer fallback:
  - context-text narrowing in `PDFViewer` previously attempted only once after 220ms.
  - when text layer was not ready in that window, coarse highlight fallback persisted.
- Implemented viewer hotfix in `src/components/chat/PDFViewer.tsx`:
  - retry loop for context-text highlight resolution.
  - temporary suppression of coarse overlay while refinement is in progress.
  - status chip `Refining highlight...` during narrowing.
- Re-ran validation after hotfix:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (38 tests).
- Current status: reingest + smoke checks complete; final manual browser confirmation of citation highlight precision is pending.
- Additional root-cause review confirmed a second-order issue:
  - viewer can report `context-text` while highlight is mis-anchored (thin top strip) on known problematic PDF page.
- Implementation started for deep-fix track (dual-read + spatial gate):
  - added `highlightText` plumbing in source payload types and chat API mapping.
  - added DB migration scaffold for `chunks.highlight_text`.
  - added ingest snippet generation for `highlight_text`.
  - rewired viewer context cache key to page + normalized context + highlight signature.
  - replaced global lexical span resolver with region-first resolver + spatial validation gate.
  - added deterministic `bbox-fallback` mode and debug reason codes (`context_no_tokens`, `context_no_ranked_spans`, `context_spatial_gate_fail`, `context_bbox_fallback`).
  - added unit tests for geometry/signature helpers and chat context payload helpers.
- Validation after deep-fix implementation:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run test:run` passed (`45/45`).
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Current status: code and automated gates are green; remaining work is browser regression matrix on known problematic citation flow.
